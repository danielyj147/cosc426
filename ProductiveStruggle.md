## Struggling productively in this class

All 400-level CS classes at Colgate University are intended to provide students with a capstone like experience. This means that by the end of this class you are expected to demonstrate the ability to work independently to solve problems and answer questions. This involves finding the balance between struggling productively and asking for help. The following policies are intended to help cultivate this balance. 

## Policies

1. I will not answer questions about provided code for the HW or lab, or help you debug errors from trying to run this code, less than 72 hours before the HW or lab is due. This means that you should make sure to understand all of the provided code, and how it interacts with the tasks for the HW or lab before you try to fully tackle any specific part. 

2. I will not help debug any issues with installing environments, running files, etc after the first three weeks of the semester over email. By this point you should have run some version of what you need to do kn a lab or HW. So talk to your peers, post your question on discord or go to TA open lab hours to debug this issue. 

3. If you send me an email (or Discord message) about other types of errors, you should make sure to include a [Minimum Reproducible Example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_reproducible_example). If there is too little or too much detail, I will not follow up with you through a sequence of emails trying to get the necessary/appropriate information; I will instead ask you to stop by office hours with an MRE.  

4. If you ask me a question about some concept you find challenging, more often than not I will ask you another question that is intended to help you figure out the answer, instead of directly giving the answer. This means that you should leave yourself enough time to find answers to questions, and not come to me a few hours (or even just one day) before an assignment is due.  



## Things to do when you run into errors or challenges

- If you are having issues with installing environments, running files, etc before you reach out to me, pause and ask yourself these questions: Have you had to do something similar in a previous lab or homework? How is what you are doing different from what you've done before? Which of these changes are causing the error? 

- If something is running for very long, and you are unsure if it should take that long or if your code is incorrect, can you scale down the task and see if it runs more quickly? Note scaling down the task does not always mean changing some number superficially; it will likely require you to read the code you are trying to run, and figure out how the task is implemented or broken down. 

- In general it is always good practice to write or test code incrementally: start with a small set of examples and/or try running a few lines of code at a time before scaling up. Similarly, if you are modifying some existing code, change one thing at at time instead of changing everything at once.
