- [ ] How do I make the results less boring using analyze? Right now with
  whatever I've done it just gives me two aggregate measures. I want to keep
track of by-pronoun results maybe? This is fine for now ultimately.
   - Grusha: Adding in pronoun in as a condition should work? 


## Thinking about analyze (for long term)
- I'd like to be able to take the difference based on custom groupings or
  something. For this, I'd like to know the subject-preference (difference
between subject and object pronoun probability) by IC verb. What do I need to do
this with your analyze stuff? 

## Grusha thoughts/questions + ideas for LabB

- Have your students heard the term "templates"? If not, any thoughts on how you were going to present it?
- Splitting part 1 into two parts might be helpful
  1. Understanding the phenomenon: what counts as minimal pair, why is stereotypical gender interesting, spend time developing judgments, playing with interact to verify judgments
  2. Thinking about how to use the toolkit: why need templates, what would template look like, what experiment and mode.
 
- Before part 2: have questions that require them to think through what are all the columns of the ROI
  1. sentence vs. pair vs. context
  2. Condition vs. lemma
  3. ROI
 
- If things feel too long, consider scaffolding the template creation part: e.g., give them the kinds of things they would need to vary (noun, verb) and have them explain why/ code it up. (Then for Lab3 they can really think through how to structure template with the grammars they write)
