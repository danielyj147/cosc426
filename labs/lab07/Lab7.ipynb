    "\n",
    "    First the `compute_loss` function loads the training data to the selected device(e.g., CPU, GPU), then it predicts y given X by using the model. After the prediction, the function calculates the loss of the predicted result by comparing it to the expected result. This process gets reapted for all the examples in the data to calculate the total loss which then gets divied by the number of examples to get the average loss. \n",
