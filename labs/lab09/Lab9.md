# COSC 426 F24 Lab 9

## Introduction

One of the goals of this course is to train NLP Scholars who can critically reason about what kinds of results about NLP systemsâ€™ capabilities (or their lack thereof) get hyped and why, while describing the impact that this hype can
have on society. To demonstrate this, you will write a 1-2 page "Society Reflection" paper. The goal of this lab is to get you started with writing this paper, and maybe even finishing it!

## What to submit

A 1-2 page paper on the gradescope for your **course** section. 

## Part 1

Find a news article that discusses advances in NLP. Here is a (non-comprehensive) list of journalists who have written about this topic. You can look for articles they've written, or find your own. 

*If you are having trouble finding articles, or are finding articles that are behind a paywall, talk to your lab instructor*

## Part 2

Identify the central claims being made in this paper. Which of the claims adopt a positive approach to the advances, and which ones adopt a negative approach?  

## Part 3
What kind of evidence would you need to evaluate the claims being made in the paper? What kind of evidence does the article use to substantiate the claims? This part needs to concretely refer to concepts or use tools you have encountered in this class. For example, if the article references a benchmark, one thing you can do is to look at the actual examples in the benchmark in the `interact` mode in `NLPScholar` to develop intuitions for what the benchmark is supposed to be measuring vs. what it is actually measuring. 

## Part 4

Evaluate whether the claims in the article are justified.  Reason about **why** these claims are being made and what societal impact these claims have. 

## Part 5

Synthesize all of your insights into a 1-2 page paper!
